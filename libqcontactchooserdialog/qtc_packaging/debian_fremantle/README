The Debian Package libqcontactchooserdialog
----------------------------

libqtcontactchooserdialog is a replacement for the Maemo contact choosing dialog.
It has all of the features of the original.  In addition, any of the contacts can
be selected programmatically, that is, prior to displaying the dialog. That isn't
possible with the standard dialog.
