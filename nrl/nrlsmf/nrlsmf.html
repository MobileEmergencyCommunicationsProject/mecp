An interprocess communication "remote control" interface is provided so that a compatible program (e.g. <span class="emphasis"><em><a href="http://cs.itd.nrl.navy.mil/work/olsr" target="_top">nrlolsrd</a></em></span>) may issue run-time commands to <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> to dynamically control the multicast forwarding process. Both IPv4 and IPv6 operation are supported. Versions of <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> can be built for the following operating systems: Linux, MacOS, BSD, Win32, and WinCE. The code base also supports working simulation models of SMF in the <span class="emphasis"><em>ns-2</em></span> and OPNET discrete event simulation environments. In the future it is hoped that the SMF functionality might be included as part of operating system kernels.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="TheoryOfOperation"></a>2.&nbsp;Theory of Operation</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> program acts as a user-space packet forwarding engine by promiscuously "sniffing" packets on a specified interface or intercepting packets using operating system firewall facilities and then retransmitting packets (using its local network interface MAC address) according to set forwarding rules. Packets can be received and possibly forwarded on a single, specified network interface for operation within a "routing area" corresponding to that single (generally wireless) interface. And, <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> also provides for packet reception and forwarding across multiple interfaces to allow for configurable gateway operation and/or multicast distribution across a set of interfaces. Only incoming (non-locally generated), non-link-local IP Multicast packets with time-to-live (TTL) greater than one are considered for forwarding. Duplicate packet detection is an important facet of wireless network multicast forwarding since packets often must be forwarded on the same interface as they are received. Thus, neighbors' subsequent retransmission of forwarded packets will be "heard" and the local forwarding engine must discriminate between new packets and previously-forwarded packets to avoid unnecessary retransmission.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="Usage"></a>3.&nbsp;Usage</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> program provides a command-line syntax with which it can be launched.

A single instance of <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> will distribute traffic among all interfaces. If independent interfaces (or groups) are desired, then the user should invoke multiple instances of <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span>. For example, the syntaxes:</p><p>"<code class="literal">nrlsmf cf eth0 cf eth1</code>"</p><p>and</p><p>"<code class="literal">nrlsmf cf eth0,eth1</code>"</p><p>are equivalent. Both result in flooding of packets received on interfaces "eth0" and "eth1" to/among both of these interfaces. If two <span class="emphasis"><em>separate</em></span> instances of <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> are launched (one per interface) using the syntax</p><p>"<code class="literal">nrlsmf cf eth0; nrlsmf cf eth1</code>"</p><p>then the flooding is limited to each respective interface (i.e. packets received on "eth0" are possibly retransmitted only on "eth0"). Future versions of <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> _might_ provide the ability to set up multiple interface groupings with a single <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> instance.</p><p>Using <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> as a "gateway" between a typical network interface (e.g. Ethernet) and a MANET interface (e.g. 802.11 in ad hoc mode) can be accomplished using the "push" or "merge" commands (or their "r" (resequencing) variants). For example if it is desired to "push" multicast traffic from a non-MANET interface (perhaps connected to a multicast router) "eth0" to a MANET interface "eth1", resequencing (or adding IPv6 SMF_DPD option header), run "classical flooding" on the MANET interface, _and_ push multicast traffic originated on the MANET area to the non-MANET interface, the following syntax could be used:</p><p><code class="literal">nrlsmf rpush eth0,eth1 push eth1,eth0 cf eth1</code></p><p>Here the "<code class="literal">rpush the0,eth1</code>" command forces relay of traffic from eth0-&gt;eth1 and labels the packets (via the IPv4 ID field or IPv6 SMF_DPD option) for proper SMF duplicate packet detection. The "<code class="literal">push eth1,eth0</code>" command directs traffic from the MANET interface "eth1" to the non-MANET "eth0" interface, assuming that any traffic on MANET interface has already been "sequenced" (or tagged) appropriately for SMF duplicate packet detection. Note that <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> maintains duplicate packet detection state for the "rpush" associate so that packet relayed from eth0 to eth1 are not reintroduced back to eth0 from eth1 even when other neighboring MANET nodes may retransmit those packets to support SMF data dissemination. Finally, the "<code class="literal">cf eth1</code>" command provides "classical flooding" on the presumably MANET eth1 interface (i.e. retransmitting received multicast packets so that other neighbors out-of-range of the heard transmission may receive the packets). Note that the "<code class="literal">smpr</code>" or "<code class="literal">ecds</code>" commands could be used here instead of "<code class="literal">cf</code>" for more efficient group data distribution if supporting neighborhood discovery protocol (NHDP) (or equivalent) information is operating and controlling <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> state.

If this "<code class="literal">hash</code>" command is used in conjunction with "<code class="literal">idpd on</code>", I-DPD is performed for all packets except non-fragmented, non-IPSec IPv6 packets. For those excepted IPv6 packets, H-DPD is used and the SMF "Hash Assist Value" (HAV) is applied as needed when the "<code class="literal">resequence on</code>" option or "<code class="literal">rpush</code>/<code class="literal">rmerge</code>" operation is configured. Note that, depending upon the hash algorithm selected, this technique may be somewhat processing-intensive compared to the default approach that assumes an embedded unique identifier ("packetId") in packet headers. The "<code class="literal">hash</code>" and "<code class="literal">ihash</code>" commands are mutually exclusive and their use supercedes any prior hashing configuration. If I-DPD is disabled and no hash algorithm is specfiied, no duplicate packet detection occurs.

However, H-DPD operation is not invoked as a result of this command. Instead, the specified hash algorithm is used to calculate an "internal hash" value that is concatenated with the explicit I-DPD identifier for duplicate packet detection. This mode of operation enhances I-DPD operation, making it less vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks against SMF where spoofed packets with misleading packet identifiers may be generated by bad-behaving nodes. Note that <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> "<code class="literal">ihash</code>" behavior when I-DPD is disabled (i.e., "<code class="literal">idpd off</code>") is undefined but will generally result in essentially H-DPD operation for forwarded flows.

This allows for external processes to insert themselves into the SMF forwarding process and provide additional filtering, etc of packets that SMF would forward. The "argument" of the "<code class="literal">smfPkt</code>" command is actually a binary format that includes a header with forwarding information and an entire Ether-type frame structure (i.e., 14-byte Ether-type header and IP packet payload). Since the "smfPkt" string and its delimiting ASCII "space" character is a total of 7 bytes in length, the binary content begins at the 8th byte of the "smfPkt" command message.</p><p>The binary content begins with 1 byte that is an "indexCount", that indicates the length of a list of interface indices that immediately follows. Each interface index is one byte. The first interface index in the list identifies the the network interface upon which the subject packet arrived (i.e., the "inbound interface index"). The remaining interface indices in the list (the "outbound interface index list") are the interfaces on which the subject packet will be (or would have been) forwarded by the <span class="emphasis"><em>nrlsmf</em></span> process. Again, note that the "indexCount" is one greater than the number of outbound interface indices (i.e., the count includes the inbound interface index).</p><p>Immediately following the list of interface indices, the packet, in Ether-type frame format, is included.
